# Token Overview

$MAHA is the governance and utility token that regulates the $USDz - a yield bearing stablecoin, the MAHA community, and other products governed by the DAO.

$MAHA is integral to the MAHA ecosystem. It empowers users to participate in governance, earn rewards, and ensure the protocol's stability and growth.

$MAHA token holders can vote to allocate MAHA towards grants, strategic partnerships, governance initiatives, additional liquidity mining pools, and a host of other programs. The tokenomics are designed to promote self-sustaining community interest, developer engagement, and ecosystem adoption.

This structure ensures that $MAHA and ZAI ($USDz) work in tandem.
