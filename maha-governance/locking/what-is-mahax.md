# What is MAHAX?

MAHAX represents the voting power a user gets when they lock their MAHA tokens. It is designed to decentralize voting power, giving smaller holders the ability to have significant influence by locking their tokens for longer periods.

MAHAX is calculated using a simple formula that takes into account time and the number of tokens locked.

$$
𝐴𝑚𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑚𝑎ℎ𝑎𝑥=(𝐴𝑚𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑚𝑎ℎ𝑎∗𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠)/(365∗4)Amountmahax​=(Amountmaha​∗days)/(365∗4)
$$

The below table showcases an example of how much MAHAX a person receives, given 1000 MAHA that is locked across various intervals of time. However note that a user can choose any interval between `2 weeks` to `4 years`.



| For 1000 MAHA locked | Lock Duration |
| -------------------- | ------------- |
| `1000 MAHAX`         | 4 years       |
| `250 MAHAX`          | 1 year        |
| `127.4 MAHAX`        | 6 month       |
| `63.7 MAHAX`         | 3 month       |
| `21.23 MAHAX`        | 1 month       |
| `4.79 MAHAX`         | 1 week        |

## Voting power that decays over time <a href="#voting-power-that-decays-over-time" id="voting-power-that-decays-over-time"></a>

One of the most important properties of a true democracy is the right of members to secede from the group. Transitioning of power is an important aspect of any future footed governance. Current participants need to give space for newer participants to come forward.

First-mover advantages within the MAHA ecosystem can lead to governance structures centralized to early adopters, making it harder for power to secede successfully.

This is why having the voting power decay slowly over time is important in creating future-footed governance.

Unless staked, every `MAHAX` NFT has its voting power, decay over time if it is not participating in active governance. This creates an incentive for holders to not just stake their NFTs but also have voting power that secedes if unstaked.

The end goal is to have a fully decentralized governance model that is evenly spread out and allows room for new participants to join in.
