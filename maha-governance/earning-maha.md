# Earning MAHA

MAHA tokens are distributed to protocol users for performing a variety of actions. These rewards are designed to incentivize active participation and support the stability and growth of the ecosystem. Here are some key ways users can earn MAHA:

#### Minting New ZAI

Creating new ZAI by locking up collateral also earns users MAHA. This process supports the circulation of ZAI and contributes to the overall liquidity and utility of the stablecoin.

#### LP Staking

Providing liquidity to the various pools is an essential part of the MAHA ecosystem. By staking LP tokens, users can earn additional MAHA rewards. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Provide Liquidity**: Users can provide liquidity to the ZAI/MAHA pool on supported DEX.
2. **Receive LP Tokens**: In return for providing liquidity, users receive LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens.
3. **Stake LP Tokens**: Users can stake these LP tokens in the MAHA protocol through the dApp.
4. **Earn MAHA**: Stakers will earn MAHA rewards based on the amount of LP tokens staked and the duration of their stake.
