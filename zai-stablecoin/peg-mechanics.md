# Peg Mechanics

The pegging mechanism of ZAI ($USDz) ensures that it maintains a 1:1 ratio with the US Dollar. This is achieved through a combination of collateralization, algorithmic adjustments, and market incentives.

### **Collateralization**:

Every ZAI ($USDz) minted is backed by Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) such as Renzo Restaked ETH (ezETH), Kelp DAO Restaked ETH (rsETH), or Wrapped eETH (weETH). This ensures that each ZAI ($USDz) is fully collateralized by valuable assets.

### **Algorithmic Adjustments**

The protocol adjusts the supply of ZAI ($USDz) based on market demand. If ZAI ($USDz) trades above its peg, new ZAI ($USDz) can be minted to increase supply. Conversely, if ZAI ($USDz) trades below its peg, users are incentivized to burn ZAI ($USDz) to reduce supply.

### **Market Incentives**

Arbitrage opportunities and incentives are in place to maintain the peg. If ZAI's price deviates from $1, traders can profit by buying or selling ZAI ($USDz) until it returns to its 1:1 peg with USD.

By utilizing these mechanisms, ZAI maintains its stability and ensures it consistently holds its value relative to the US Dollar.
