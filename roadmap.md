# Roadmap

The following is a rough roadmap for the ZAI stablecoin.&#x20;

## Phase 0: Early Bootstrap Mode

In this phase we focus on bootstrapping liquidity for ZAI and aim to grow the liquidity and the market valuation of ZAI to 500-1mn$.&#x20;

Users can mint ZAI using stablecoins and will be incentivized with MAHA emissions. Accepted stablecoins will be USDC, DAI, USDe and ZAI will be minted using the [Peg Stability Module](zai-stablecoin/peg-mechanics/peg-stablility-module.md).

Once the protocol hits the 500k-1mn$ liquidity mark, we will move onto Phase 2.

## Phase 1: Early Lending Stage

In this phase we will launch ZAI into a few lending markets using the [Direct Deposit Module](zai-stablecoin/peg-mechanics/direct-deposit-module.md) and accept a few assets as collateral to allow ZAI to be borrowed against them.&#x20;

Initially the protocol will limit the amount of ZAI minted to lending protocols to be no more than 50% of the available liquidity on DEXes. This is kept to ensure that there's strong peg support as borrowers sell their ZAI for leveraged exposure.

In this phase, the protocol starts to generate lending and borrowing revenue which starts to go back to LP stakers.

This phase will last for 2-3 months and can get extended depending on the growth of the protocol

## Phase 2: MAHA Points

More information about this phase will go live soon.

## Phase 3: Cross-chain expansion

We start to expand to ZAI to multiple chains and provide liquidity to lending protocols across other chains allowing leverage traders to borrow ZAI.

In this phase, we will also aim to enable cross-chain native re-staking which will allow users to mint ZAI with native USDC/USDT minted on these chains.

***

Within these four phases we aim to convert ZAI into a fully functioning stablecoin with deep liquidity and integrations within the DeFi ecosystem.
