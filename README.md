# Welcome

MAHA (previously known as MahaDAO) is a community-powered decentralized organization. Our mission is to create a stablecoin that is deeply rooted into the Ether-sphere. With integrations towards LRTs, Lending Protocols and DeFi for growth.

At the heart of the ecosystem are two main tokens. MAHA and ZAI.

## Why ZAI?

ZAI serves as an important liquidity enabler for asset classes that has emerged within the crypto-sphere. Combined with the Direct Deposit Module, ZAI can be used to instantly leverage on these assets and able to scale to millions if not billions of dollars of liquidity quickly.&#x20;

Asset classes that ZAI aims to provide leverage liquidity for are:

* Liquid Re-staking Tokens (LRTs)
* Bitcoin Derivatives (Lombard, Merlin BTC etc..)
* RWAs
* DeFi Assets (Pendle PT tokens, LP tokens, Liquid Lockers etc..)

## Key Features

These are the key features that make ZAI particularly unique from other stablecoins out there.

* **Over-collateralized lending:** Users can access liquidity against their volatile crypto without having to sell the assets by taking a loan in ZAI.
* **Leverage**: Expanding upon the over-collateralized lending model, users can loop their positions to further leverage their exposure to various assets.
* **Direct Deposit Module:** To further expand ZAI's liquidity outside of the over-collateralized trove system, the direct deposit module allows governance to supply ZAI into third party lending protocols and accure interest fees from borrowers.
* **Strong Incentive Loops:** Revenue generated from the protocol is redirected back to stakers and LPs, which creates a strong feedback loop to further create more liquidity and more incentives.

### **Governance Token: $MAHA**

$MAHA is crucial to our ecosystem for **providing security and incentives**. It helps ensure the smooth operation and growth of ZAI.&#x20;

### **Stablecoin: $ZAI (USDz)**

$ZAI, or USDz, is a yield-bearing stablecoin designed to promote economic stability within the MAHA ecosystem.

Users can mint ZAI against stablecoins at a 0% interest rate or can borrow ZAI against liquid restaking tokens (LRTs) and other DeFi assets.&#x20;

By leveraging LRTs, users can borrow $ZAI and earn real yield, contributing to the ecosystem's overall health and liquidity.
