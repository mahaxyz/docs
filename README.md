# Welcome to MAHA

## What is MAHA?

MAHA (previously MahaDAO) is a community-powered, decentralized organization with a mission to create a stable economy through its 0% interest Liquid Restaking-based stablecoin, ZAI (USDz).

## Key Components

### **Governance Token: $MAHA**

* **Security and Incentives**: $MAHA secures and incentivizes the entire ecosystem.
* **Rewards**: Holders earn rewards from the growth of the economy.
* **Scarcity and Revenue Generation**: $MAHA is scarce. Only $10 million MAHA generated.

### **Stablecoin: $ZAI (USDz)**

* **Yield-Bearing**: $ZAI is a yield-bearing stablecoin that can be borrowed against liquid restaking tokens at a 0% interest fee.
* **Utility**: Users can earn real yield by borrowing $ZAI using their LRTs.

## Launch Features

Users are currently able to:

### **Borrow**

* Deposit LRTs as collateral.
* Borrow $USDz at a 0% interest fee.

### **Redeem**

* Use $USDz to participate in the stability pool, farm across DeFi, or simply hold it.

### **Earn**

* Redeem collateral at any time by repaying your loan with $USDz.

### **Stake/Unstake**

### Governance and Community

* **Community-Focused**: MAHA is completely community-focused, with the DAO playing a central role in every decision.

MAHA provides a platform for borrowing, redeeming, and earning with $ZAI, all governed by the community through the $MAHA token.
