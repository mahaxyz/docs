# Welcome

MAHA (previously known as MahaDAO) is a community-powered decentralized organization. Our mission is to create a stablecoin that is deeply rooted into the Ether-sphere. With integrations towards LRTs, Lending Protocols and DeFi for growth.

MAHA (previously known as MahaDAO) is a community-powered decentralized organization. Our mission is to create a stable and thriving economy through innovative financial products, notably our 0% interest Liquid Restaking-based stablecoin, ZAI (USDz).

At the heart of the ecosystem are two main tokens. MAHA and ZAI.

## Why ZAI?

ZAI serves as an important liquidity enabler for asset classes that has emerged within the crypto-sphere. Combined with the Direct Deposit Module, ZAI can be used to instantly leverage on these assets and able to scale to millions if not billions of dollars of liquidity quickly.&#x20;

Asset classes that ZAI aims to provide leverage liquidity for are:

* Liquid Re-staking Tokens (LRTs)
* Bitcoin Derivatives (Lombard, Merlin BTC etc..)
* RWAs
* DeFi Assets (Pendle PT tokens, LP tokens, Liquid Lockers etc..)

## Key Features

These are the key features that make ZAI particularly unique from other stablecoins out there.

* **Over-collateralized lending:** Users can access liquidity against their volatile crypto without having to sell the assets by taking a loan in ZAI.
* **Leverage**: Expanding upon the over-collateralized lending model, users can loop their positions to further leverage their exposure to various assets.
* **Direct Deposit Module:** To further expand ZAI's liquidity outside of the over-collateralized trove system, the direct deposit module allows governance to supply ZAI into third party lending protocols and accure interest fees from borrowers.
* **Strong Incentive Loops:** Revenue generated from the protocol is redirected back to stakers and LPs, which creates a strong feedback loop to further create more liquidity and more incentives.

$MAHA is crucial to our ecosystem for **providing security and incentives**. It helps ensure the smooth operation and growth of ZAI.&#x20;

Users can mint ZAI against stablecoins at a 0% interest rate or can borrow ZAI against liquid restaking tokens (LRTs) and other DeFi assets.&#x20;

Users can borrow against liquid restaking tokens (LRTs) at a 0% interest rate, making it a cost-effective borrowing solution.

At the heart of the ecosystem are two main tokens. MAHA and ZAI.

## Why ZAI?

Unlike most complicated stablecoin designs out there, ZAI focuses on a very simple design (the entire stablecoin is less than 400 lines of code) and provides instant liquidity to borrowers.

Combined with the [Direct Deposit Module](zai-stablecoin/direct-deposit-module.md), ZAI can be used to instantly leverage on these assets and able to scale to millions if not billions of dollars of liquidity quickly.

ZAI aims to provide leverage liquidity for:

* Liquid Re-staking Tokens (LRTs)
* Bitcoin Derivatives (Lombard, Merlin BTC etc..)
* RWAs
* DeFi Assets (Pendle PT tokens, LP tokens, Liquid Lockers etc..)

## Key Features <a href="#key-features" id="key-features"></a>

These are the key features that make ZAI particularly unique from other stablecoins out there.

* **Strong Peg Mechanics:** With the help of the [Peg Stability Module](zai-stablecoin/peg-stablility-module.md), ZAI is kept at a peg of 1$ with a collateral basket consisting of various stablecoins.
* **Instant Lending Liquidity:** The ZAI [Direct Deposit Module](zai-stablecoin/direct-deposit-module.md) allows supplies ZAI to various lending protocols to allow users to borrow ZAI as debt with their assets as collateral. Users can then use the ZAI to either leverage or de-risk from their collateral.
* **Strong Incentive Loops:** Revenue generated from the protocol is redirected back to stakers and LPs, which creates a strong feedback loop to further create more liquidity and more incentives. See [Revenue & Liquidity Incentives](zai-stablecoin/liquidity-incentives.md).
* **Minimalistic Design:** The entire stablecoin design including the various modules fits in less than 400 lines of code.
