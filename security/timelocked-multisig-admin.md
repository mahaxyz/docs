# Timelocked Multisig Admin

MAHA employs a time lock mechanism on all administrative functions, including proxy contracts, to enhance the security of our protocol. This mechanism is overseen by a multi-signature contract, ensuring robust protection until decentralized governance is fully introduced.

A time-locked multi-signature administration will secure our protocol, requiring consensus from at least two out of three authorized parties for any transaction proposal. The proposed transaction becomes executable only after a designated 24-hour waiting period, which can be extended if necessary.

Here are the contract addresses for your reference:

* **Timelock Contract**: \[Add Address Here]

These wallet addresses have the authority to sign transactions within the multi-sig contract:
