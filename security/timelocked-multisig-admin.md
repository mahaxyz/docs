# Timelocked Multisig Admin

#### MAHA Security Protocol: Time-Lock and Multi-Signature Mechanism

MAHA employs a time lock mechanism on all administrative functions, including proxy contracts, to enhance the security of our protocol. This mechanism is overseen by a multi-signature contract, ensuring robust protection until decentralized governance is fully introduced.

### **Key Security Features:**

1. **Time-Locked Multi-Signature Administration:**
   * Our protocol is secured by a time-locked multi-signature administration requiring consensus from at least three out of five authorized parties for any transaction proposal (previously two out of three).
   * The proposed transaction becomes executable only after a designated 5-day waiting period (previously 24 hours), except for risk management actions.
2. **Scope of Time-Lock Multi-Signature:**
   * The upgraded time-lock multi-signature applies to new asset listings and administrative changes.
