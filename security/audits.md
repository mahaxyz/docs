# Audits

### Halborn Audits

MAHA is committed to maintaining the highest security standards for our protocol. Currently, we are undergoing comprehensive security audits conducted by Halborn. These audits are designed to identify and mitigate any potential vulnerabilities within our system, ensuring the safety and integrity of our protocol.

### Mundus Security Audits

In addition to the ongoing Halborn audits, MAHA has successfully completed security audits with Mundus Security. The findings and recommendations from Mundus Security have been meticulously implemented to fortify our protocol against any threats.

We remain dedicated to continuous improvement and transparency, and we will keep our community informed about the progress and results of these audits.
