# Audits

MAHA smart contracts were audited by Halborn.

However, security audits don't eliminate risks completely. Please don’t supply your life savings, or assets you can’t afford to lose, to  MAHA, especially as a liquidity provider.

### Secondary Security Audits

In addition to the Halborn audits, MAHA has successfully completed security audits with Mundus Security. The findings and recommendations from Mundus Security have been meticulously implemented to fortify our protocol against any threats.

For more details on the Mundus Security audit, you can read their [Review of MahaDAO Governance Security Audit](https://mundus.dev/blog/tpost/okfzlvdcr1-review-of-mahadao-governance-security-au).
