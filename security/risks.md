# Risks

Being a lending-focused stablecoin, there are mainly two kinds of risks that the entire protocol can be exposed to and what preventive measures have been taken to protect the protocol.

***

## 1. Technical Risks

Risks relating to the smart-contracts, code, frontends, infrastructure. Technical risks can be mitigated with audits and best security practices.

### **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**

* **Code Exploits**: Bugs or vulnerabilities in the smart contract code can be exploited by malicious actors, leading to loss of funds or manipulation of the stablecoin system.
* **Upgradability Issues**: If the smart contract is upgradable, it introduces risks related to governance attacks or improper implementation of upgrades.

### **Collateral Management Risks**

* **Over-collateralization**: Ensuring that loans are sufficiently over-collateralized to manage market volatility. Failure to maintain proper collateral ratios can lead to insolvency.
* **Collateral Liquidation**: The process of liquidating collateral in the event of loan defaults must be efficient and robust. Technical failures in liquidation mechanisms can cause system-wide issues.

### **Blockchain Risks**

* **Network Congestion**: High transaction volume on the underlying blockchain can cause delays and increased costs, affecting the stablecoin’s usability.
* **Cross-Chain Interactions**: If the stablecoin interacts with other blockchains, there are additional risks related to the security and reliability of cross-chain bridges and protocols.
* **Forks and Upgrades**: Changes to the underlying blockchain protocol can introduce compatibility issues or vulnerabilities in the stablecoin’s smart contracts.

### **Price Oracle Risks**

* **Oracle Manipulation**: Reliance on price oracles to determine collateral value introduces risks of manipulation, leading to improper collateralization levels.
* **Oracle Downtime**: If the price oracles go down or provide incorrect data, it can lead to incorrect valuations and risk assessments.

### **Peg Stability Mechanisms**

* **Algorithmic Failures**: If the stablecoin uses algorithmic mechanisms to maintain its peg, any flaws or bugs in these algorithms can cause de-pegging.
* **Market Manipulation**: External market forces or manipulative actions can challenge the stability of the peg.

### Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate the various technical risks, we perform the following steps.

1. **Code Audits**: Regular and thorough audits by reputable third parties.
2. **Formal Verification**: Use formal methods to mathematically prove the correctness of smart contracts.
3. **Robust Oracles**: Employ decentralized, reliable oracles with redundancy.&#x20;
4. **Fail-safes and Circuit Breakers**: Implement mechanisms to halt operations in case of detected anomalies.
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive testing in both simulated and real-world environments.
6. **Insurance Mechanisms**: Establish insurance funds or integrate with insurance protocols to cover potential losses.

## 2. Economic Risks

Risks relating to the liquidity, incentives, governance, peg etc.. Economic risks can be mitigated with dedicated risk managers observing the protocol.

### **Market Volatility**

* **Collateral Value Fluctuation**: The value of collateral backing the stablecoin can fluctuate significantly, especially if it’s in volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. This can lead to under-collateralization and potential insolvency.
* **Stablecoin Demand**: Fluctuations in demand for the stablecoin itself can impact its price stability, leading to periods of de-pegging or excessive inflation.

### **Interest Rate Risk**

* **Variable Rates**: Changes in interest rates for lending and borrowing can affect the profitability and attractiveness of the stablecoin. If interest rates are not well-managed, it can lead to liquidity issues or uncompetitive rates.
* **Interest Rate Models**: Flaws in the algorithm or model determining interest rates can lead to economic imbalances, impacting both lenders and borrowers.

### **Liquidity Risk**

* **Liquidity Mismatch**: If there’s a mismatch between the liquidity of the stablecoin and the underlying collateral, it can lead to problems during redemption or liquidation processes.
* **Market Depth**: Insufficient market depth can cause large trades to significantly impact the stablecoin’s price, leading to slippage and volatility.

### **Redemption Risk**

* **Mass Redemption**: In the event of a sudden surge in redemptions, the stablecoin issuer may face challenges in liquidating collateral quickly enough to meet demands, leading to a potential run on the stablecoin.
* **Redemption Fees**: High redemption fees or delays can deter users from redeeming the stablecoin, impacting its perceived value and stability.

### **Collateral Diversification Risk**

* **Concentration Risk**: If the collateral is concentrated in a few assets or asset types, it increases exposure to specific market risks and events that can significantly impact the stablecoin’s stability.
* **Collateral Quality**: The quality and reliability of collateral assets can impact the overall health of the stablecoin. Low-quality or illiquid collateral increases risk.

### **Governance Risk**

* **Decision-Making Delays**: Delayed or poor economic decisions due to inefficient governance mechanisms can negatively impact the stablecoin’s stability and user confidence.
* **Conflict of Interest**: Conflicts within the governance structure can lead to decisions that prioritize certain stakeholders over the stability and health of the stablecoin.

### **Systemic Risk**

* **DeFi Interdependencies**: The stablecoin’s integration with other DeFi protocols can expose it to systemic risks where failures or issues in other protocols can cascade and impact the stablecoin.
* **Global Economic Conditions**: Macroeconomic events and conditions can affect the underlying assets and overall confidence in stablecoins, influencing their stability and adoption.

### Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate the various economic risks, we perform the following steps.

1. **Diversified Collateral**: Using a diverse set of collateral assets to minimize concentration risk.
2. **Dynamic Interest Rates**: Implementing adaptive interest rate mechanisms to respond to market conditions.
3. **Liquidity Management**: Ensuring robust liquidity reserves and mechanisms to handle redemption surges.
4. **Risk Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring and assessment of economic risks to make proactive adjustments.
5. **Strong Governance**: Establishing a transparent and efficient governance framework to manage economic policies effectively.

While the above list of risks is exhaustive, it does not cover every possibility that the protocol could be exposed to.&#x20;
