# Revenue Share

The MAHA ecosystem has various sources of revenue, which are collected at a single place and distributed across various entities. Revenue comes from the following channels:

1. **Borrowing Fees**: Users that borrow ZAI pay a borrowing interest in the form of ZAI. This is the main focus for scaling the protocol.
2. **Redemption Fees:** Any time a user redeems ZAI for the underlying stablecoins, a 1-3% redemption fee is charged in the stablecoin.

### Key Innovations:

* **Dynamic Fee Allocation:** JeremyAI shifts fee shares between pools weekly based on utilization rates. &#x20;
* **Anti-Fragile Safety Pool:** Fees scale with redemption pressure, deterring speculative attacks. &#x20;
* **AI Sustainability:** 10% funding ensures JeremyAI operates independently without draining MAHAâ€™s fixed supply.&#x20;

## How Revenue Gets Distributed

Once revenue is collected, it is sent to various sources to grow the protocol. A large portion of the revenue is redirected to liquidity pools, as without liquidity, the protocol cannot scale.

For the ZAI stablecoin, all revenue will be converted into USDC and distributed back to stakeholders.
