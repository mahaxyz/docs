# Staking FAQs



**Can I make multiple locks using a single wallet?**&#x20;

Yes, you can create multiple locks as long as each meets the minimum criteria (currently set at 100 MAHAX).

**What happens if my lock expires?**

When a lock expires, your voting power drops to 0. The NFT does not get burnt unless you choose to do so.

**Do I lose my voting power over time?**

Yes, MAHAX decays over time unless staked, which freezes the voting power. If you unstake, extend your lock, or lock more MAHA, the voting power is recalculated.

**What happens if an NFT is staked but also listed on an NFT marketplace like OpenSea?**

Staked NFTs cannot be transferred. If listed on OpenSea, the transaction will fail, and a function will kick the NFT from staking to allow the sale to proceed. This prevents unwanted floor price manipulation.
