# Locking

{% hint style="info" %}
Locking MAHA is handled by the locker contract, which is currently deployed at \[\[address]]

MAHAX is a representation of the voting power a user gets when they lock their `MAHA`. It is calculated using two metrics:

* How long is the MAHA locked for?
* How much MAHA is locked?

The goal of this kind of mechanism is to create a fair and decentralized distribution of voting power that gives as much power to the common man as compared to a whale.

In most cases, smaller holders will tend to lock their tokens for longer periods of time to get the same amount of voting power as whales, who will tend to larger amounts of tokens but for lesser periods of time.

This allows participants to have their voices recognized better by simply locking their tokens for longer periods of time.
