# MAHA Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
The MAHA Token is currently deployed over at:\
[0x554bba833518793056CF105E66aBEA330672c0dE](https://basescan.org/address/0x554bba833518793056cf105e66abea330672c0de)
{% endhint %}

**MAHA** is the governance and utility token that regulates the protocol, the MAHA community, and **AI-driven products** governed by the DAO.

MAHA token holders vote to allocate MAHA toward grants, strategic partnerships, governance initiatives, liquidity mining pools, **and JeremyAI’s incentive campaigns**.

The tokenomics are designed to promote self-sustaining community growth, developer engagement, and **AI-optimized ecosystem adoption**.

#### Key Governance Roles: &#x20;

1\. Protocol Parameters: Vote on ZAI’s risk models, collateral types, fees, and JeremyAI’s operational budget (e.g., 1,000 MAHA allocated every two days). &#x20;

2\. Incentive Allocation: Approve liquidity mining pools, staking boosts, and AI-driven incentive strategies executed by JeremyAI. &#x20;

3\. Strategic Partnerships: Govern integrations with protocols like Pendle, Ethena, and **AI platforms** like DeepSeek. &#x20;

4\. Safety Pool Management: Adjust slashing parameters and bad debt resolution mechanisms.



## Why MAHA?

There are many reasons why a user would want to buy, hold, and stake the MAHA token.

* **Governance**: MAHA holders vote and make decisions on the protocol.
* **Revenue Share**: MAHA LP stakers get a portion of the protocol revenue (see [revenue share](revenue-share.md)).
* **Staking Boosts**: Users who stake MAHA get a boost on all their rewards (see[ staking boosts](staking-boosts.md)).
* **Exclusive Access**: Holding the MAHA token and staking it gives exclusive access within the community.
*   Updated:\
    **AI-Driven Protocol**: MAHA holders govern JeremyAI’s parameters, including budget allocation and incentive strategies.

    **Revenue Share:** Stakers earn a portion of protocol revenue, now amplified by JeremyAI’s efficient capital deployment.

    **Exclusive Access:** MAHA stakers gain early access to JeremyAI’s yield opportunities and governance proposals.

## Integration with JeremyAI

**JeremyAI** (@jpowellxbt) enhances MAHA’s governance by: &#x20;

1\. Automating Incentives: Dynamically allocates MAHA emissions to pools with the highest ROI, replacing manual voting for routine liquidity programs. &#x20;

2\. Proposing Strategies: Publishes on-chain reports (e.g., [Jan 30th Report](https://jpowell.ai/report?id=679ac11ebdbcc6bdc030ea92)) with AI-modeled recommendations for governance votes. &#x20;

3\. **Enforcing Transparency**: Every incentive decision is executed on-chain and auditable via transaction hashes in JeremyAI’s reports. &#x20;

#### Example: &#x20;

A governance proposal to allocate MAHA to a new Pendle PT pool is first analyzed by JeremyAI, which simulates ROI, liquidity impact, and user demand. &#x20;

MAHA holders vote based on JeremyAI’s findings, reducing guesswork and improving capital efficiency.&#x20;

### Key Features

* **Real-Time Analysis:** Tracks liquidity flows, user behavior, and market conditions to model optimal incentives.
* **Autonomous Execution**: Deploys liquidity mining programs, yield boosts, and growth campaigns without manual intervention.
  * **Phase 1 (Live):** MAHA uses JeremyAI to scale ZAI’s liquidity. &#x20;
  * **Phase 2 (Coming Soon)**: Users interact directly with JeremyAI to discover yields across DeFi.
