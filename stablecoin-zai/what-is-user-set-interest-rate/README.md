# What is user-set interest rate?

MAHA is introducing a unique approach for the ZAI stablecoin: user-set interest rates. User-set interest rates allow borrowers to choose the interest rate they are willing to pay.

This addresses the limitations of fixed, governance-based, and algorithmic interest rate models that are currently followed.

## How It Will Work

With user-set interest rates, borrowers can choose the interest rate they are willing to pay. This decision impacts their risk of redemption. Borrowers with lower interest rates are more likely to face redemptions, while those with higher rates have reduced risk.

#### Example

1. **Setting Rates**: Suppose a borrower wants to borrow ZAI. They choose an interest rate of 2%. Another borrower chooses a rate of 5%.
2. **Redemption Risk**: If the ZAI price drops and redemptions occur, the borrower with the 2% interest rate faces a higher risk of having their collateral liquidated first. The borrower with the 5% interest rate is less likely to be affected.
3. **Market Adjustment**: Over time, borrowers will adjust their rates based on market conditions and personal risk tolerance, leading to an equilibrium where interest rates reflect current market dynamics.

## Our Approach

* **Flexibility**: Allows borrowers to manage their risk and costs.
* **Efficiency**: Creates a market-driven balance between supply and demand.
* **Stability**: Helps maintain the stablecoin's peg by dynamically adjusting borrowing incentives.
