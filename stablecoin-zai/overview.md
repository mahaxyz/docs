# Overview

Recent developments in EigenLayer and restaking have significantly increased the popularity of Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs). They have seen significant growth, with billions of dollars pouring into liquid restaking protocols like [Ether.Fi](http://ether.fi), Renzo and Puffer. This growth has led to a robust LRT market with a TVL of over $10 billion in May 2024.

However, LRT holders face a common challenge: what to do with their LRTs once acquired? We encountered this issue during the development of ZeroLend, where over $140 million in Renzo ezETH was lent, yet users received low incentives and faced high borrowing APYs.

## Introducing ZAI

To address this gap, MAHA introduces $ZAI, an LRT-backed stablecoin that allows users to:

* **Mint at low Rates**: Borrow a stablecoin against their LRTs at user-set interest rates.
* **Enhance Liquidity**: Unlock liquidity for various DeFi opportunities (discussed thoroughly here)
* **Retain Rewards**: Continue earning rewards from LRTs while leveraging their value and also gain MAHA points.

### How Does ZAI (USDz) Minting Work?

\[\[how does it work from the wesite: image]

MAHA allows users to leverage their Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) to mint ZAI (USDz). To begin, users must own LRTs such as Renzo Restaked ETH (ezETH), Kelp DAO Restaked ETH (rsETH), or Wrapped eETH (weETH). These LRTs act as collateral for borrowing USDz at a specific collateral ratio.

Once USDz is minted, users can explore various DeFi activities to increase their returns, such as providing liquidity in an ETH/USDz pool or lending USDz to borrow more ETH, thereby looping for more LRT.

When users wish to retrieve their LRTs, they can repay the borrowed USDz and close the position. In the event of liquidation, the corresponding amount of ZAI will be burned.

This process enables users to unlock the potential of their assets and participate in a wide range of DeFi opportunities.
