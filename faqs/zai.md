## What is GTCR?

The Global Total Collateral Ratio (GTCR) refers to the ratio of the total value of all collaterals within the protocol (valued at current prices) to the total outstanding debt across the protocol. In simpler terms, it is the total value of all vaults' collateral measured in USD divided by the cumulative debt of all vaults in ZAI ($USDz).

## Why Recovery Mode?

Recovery Mode aims to quickly restore the GTCR above 150% by encouraging positive contributions to the Stability Pool and strategic debt repayments. During this period, minting fees are eliminated, while redemption fees remain unchanged. Liquidation rules are adjusted to allow borrowers to recover excess collateral, minimizing potential losses.
