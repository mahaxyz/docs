# Earning MAHA

MAHA tokens are distributed to protocol users for performing a variety of actions. These rewards are designed to incentivize active participation and support the stability and growth of the ecosystem. Here are some key ways users can earn MAHA:

#### 1. Depositing to the Stability Pools

Users can earn MAHA by depositing ZAI into Stability Pools. These pools play a crucial role in maintaining the protocol’s solvency by covering the debt from liquidated vaults. In return, stability providers receive rewards in the form of MAHA tokens.

#### 2. Minting New ZAI

Creating new ZAI by locking up collateral also earns users MAHA. This process supports the circulation of ZAI and contributes to the overall liquidity and utility of the stablecoin.

#### 3. Maintaining an Active ZAI Debt

Users who maintain an active debt position in ZAI are rewarded with MAHA tokens. This encourages continuous participation in the borrowing side of the protocol.

#### 4. Staking ZAI/MAHA LP Tokens

Users can earn MAHA by providing liquidity to the ZAI/MAHA liquidity pools and staking their LP tokens.

#### MAHA/ZAI LP Staking

Providing liquidity to the ZAI/MAHA pool is an essential part of the MAHA ecosystem. By staking ZAI/MAHA LP tokens, users can earn additional MAHA rewards. Here’s how it works:

1. **Provide Liquidity**: Users can provide liquidity to the ZAI/MAHA pool on supported DEX.
2. **Receive LP Tokens**: In return for providing liquidity, users receive LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens.
3. **Stake LP Tokens**: Users can stake these LP tokens in the MAHA protocol through the dApp.
4. **Earn MAHA**: Stakers will earn MAHA rewards based on the amount of LP tokens staked and the duration of their stake.
