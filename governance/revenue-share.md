# Revenue Share

The MAHA ecosystem has various sources of revenue, which get collected at a single place and distributed across various entities. Revenue comes from the following channels:

1. **Borrowing Fees**: Users that borrow ZAI pay a borrowing interest in the form of ZAI. This is the main focus for the protocol to scale.
2. **Redemption Fees:** Any time a user redeems ZAI for the underlying stablecoins, a 1-3% redemption fee is charged in the stablecoin.
3. **Opensea, NFT Marketplace Royalties:** All NFT marketplaces charge a creator fee for every sale of NFTs that happens on the protocol. This creator fee is currently set at 5-10%.

## How Revenue Gets Distributed

Once revenue gets collected, it then gets sent to various different sources to grow the protocol.
