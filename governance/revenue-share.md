# Revenue Share

The MAHA ecosystem has various sources of revenue, which get collected at a single place and distributed across various entities. Revenue comes from the following channels:

1. **Borrowing Fees**: Users that borrow ZAI pay a borrowing interest in the form of ZAI. This is the main focus for the protocol to scale.
2. **Redemption Fees:** Any time a user redeems ZAI for the underlying stablecoins, a 1-3% redemption fee is charged in the stablecoin.

Users who have staked MAHA get a boost in their revenue share of upto 5x! Read more about [staking boosts](staking-boosts.md).
{% endhint %}

## How Revenue Gets Distributed

Once revenue gets collected, it then gets sent to various different sources to grow the protocol. A large portion of the revenue is redirected to liquidity pools as without liquidity the protocol cannot scale.

For the ZAI stablecoin, all revenue will get converted into USDC and distributed back to stakers.
