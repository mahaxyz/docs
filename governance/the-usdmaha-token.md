# The $MAHA Token

$MAHA is the governance token of the MAHA protocol, empowering users to participate in the decision-making process. Since the inception of MahaDAO in January 2021, all major decisions have been governed by users who have locked their tokens for governance participation.

You can view the governance proposals here: [MAHA Governance Proposals](https://discuss.mahadao.com/c/governance/10).

The introduction of ZAI, the LRT-backed stablecoin, and the transition from our previous stablecoin model ($ARTH) were also determined through community governance.

Read the ZAI proposal here: [Introducing a Brand New MAHA](https://discuss.mahadao.com/t/introducing-a-brand-new-maha/744).

* **MAHA NFT Locks**:
  * Users lock their $MAHA tokens in the form of NFTs. Each locked NFT represents a vote in the governance process. Tutoriial here.
* **Staking & Delegation**:
  * Users can stake their locked NFTs and delegate their voting power to others.
* **Creating Proposals**:
  * Any user who staked their NFT or their delegate can create a proposal for changes to the protocol.
  * These proposals are submitted through the Governance Portal.
* **Voting**:
  * All users who have staked NFTs can vote on the proposals within a 4-day voting period.
  * They can vote "Yes" or "No" on each proposal.
* **Proposal Evaluation**:
  * After the voting period, the results are reviewed.
  * If a proposal receives enough "Yes" votes, it moves to the next step.
* **Timelocked Governor & Governor**:
  * The Timelocked Governor queues and executes approved proposals.
  * The Governor has the power to veto proposals if necessary.
* **12-Day Timelock**:
  * There is a 12-day waiting period before the approved changes are implemented. This period allows for any final reviews or emergency actions.
* **Emergency DAO**:
  * In cases of emergency, the Emergency DAO has veto rights to halt any proposal that may harm the protocol.
  * This ensures additional security and quick response to critical issues.
* **Protocol Changes**:
  * After the 12-day timelock, the approved changes are implemented into the protocol.
