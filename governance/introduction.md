# Introduction

MAHA represents a powerful intersection of community governance and a stablecoin platform designed to bring value to its users. Our tokenomics blend governance mechanisms with financial incentives.

#### $MAHA and ZAI: Core Components

* **$MAHA Token**: The core governance token of the MAHA ecosystem, enabling community-driven decision-making and protocol control.
* **ZAI Stablecoin**: A stablecoin designed to offer financial stability within the LRT ecosystem.

#### The Role of $MAHA

$MAHA is integral to the MAHA ecosystem. It empowers users to participate in governance, earn rewards, and ensure the protocol's stability and growth.

By holding and utilizing $MAHA, users contribute to the governance of the protocol and can earn incentives through various activities, such as minting ZAI, staking in liquidity pools, and participating in stability pools.

This structure ensures that $MAHA and ZAI work in tandem.
