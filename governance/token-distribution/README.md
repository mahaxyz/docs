# Token Distribution

The MAHA token has a limited supply, with a maximum of 10 million tokens that will ever be in circulation. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of the distribution and inflation mechanics:

#### Token Distribution

* **Total Supply**: 10 million MAHA tokens.
* **Community and Growth**: Over 67% of the total supply is allocated for community and ecosystem-related activities.
* **Initial Release**: On December 17th, 2020, MahaDAO conducted its first private sale and IDO, releasing approximately 8% of the supply into circulation.

#### Distribution Period

* **10-Year Plan**: The supply of MAHA is stretched out over a period of 10 years to ensure even distribution and prevent any single entity from controlling more than 1% of the supply.
* **Linear Release**: Tokens are released into circulation through a linear distribution model.

#### Inflation

* **Post 10 Years**: After the initial 10-year distribution period, the annual inflation rate will drop to 2% per year to maintain a stable supply.
